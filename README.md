pyEntropy is a lightweight library built on top of NumPy
that provides functions for computing various types of entropy for time series analysis.

The library currently supports the following types of entropy computation:

+ Shannon Entropy ```shannon_entropy```
+ Sample Entropy ```sample_entropy```
+ Multiscale Entropy ```multiscale_entropy```
+ Composite Multiscale Entropy ```composite_multiscale_entropy```
+ Permutation Entropy ```permutation_entropy```
+ Multiscale Permutation Entropy ```multiscale_permutation_entropy```
+ Weighted Permutation Entropy ```weighted_permutation_entropy```

## Quick start

Install [pyEntropy](https://github.com/nikdon/pyEntropy) using pip:

```
pip install pyentrp
```

Install [pyEntropy](https://github.com/nikdon/pyEntropy) using poetry:

```
poetry add pyentrp
```

## Usage

```python
from pyentrp import entropy as ent
import numpy as np

ts = [1, 4, 5, 1, 7, 3, 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 7, 3, 7, 9, 5, 4, 3]
std_ts = np.std(ts)
sample_entropy = ent.sample_entropy(ts, 4, 0.2 * std_ts)
```
